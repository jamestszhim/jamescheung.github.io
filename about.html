          <h2>Education </h2>
          <p>Hi, I am James, just finished my 3rd year in HKUST majoring in Computer Science and General Business Management. I was enrolled in the dual degree program (DDP) under the school of Interdisciplinary Program Office. The program offers me a degree in engineering as well as degree in business administration. So, I got the chances to take courses from business and engineering school. I like the program which allows me to explore different areas and connect different ideas across disciplines to build something interesting. At the same time, I can drill down one engineering major, and I chose computer science to be my major.</p>
          <p>Among the topics in Computer Science, in particular, I love the topics related to data analysis, mining, visualisation and artificial intelligence. Therefore, both research projects I joined was related to there fields. </p>

            <h3 class="section-subsubheading">The MBTI test</h3>
            <p>Personally, I quite like to describe my personality using the MBTI since it describe me quite well. MBTI is a theory constructed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers to describe the order of each person’s preference and choice in 4 areas. A person will be described using a 4-letter acronym, which comes from:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Introversion (I) or Extraversion (E) </li>
                <li>Intuition (N) or Sensing (S) </li>
                <li>Thinking (T) or Feeling (F) </li>
                <li>Judging (J) or Perceiving (P) </li>
              </ul>

            <h3 class="section-subsubheading">The ESFJ</h3>
            <p>So, I am of the type ESFJ, that means I am Extraversion, Sensing, Feeling and Judging. In general, ESFJ people, including me, are extraordinarily caring, social and popular people, always eager to help. </p>
            <h3 class="section-subsubheading">Workplace</h3>
            <p>In workplace, I have strong sense of responsibility and loyalty. In my past working experience, I constantly completed my tasks in time and was well-prepared for future jobs. Besides, I am a fast-learner, I pick things up fast. In my undergraduate research project I was able to learn new tools and skills and apply it in the project within short time.</p>
            <h3 class="section-subsubheading">Social Life</h3>
            <p>In social life, I am warm, caring and good at connecting with others. When working with others, I will seek harmony about other people’s feeling and strive for win-win situations for everyone. This personality allows me to be a strong team player and make a lot of good friends.</p>
            <p>Through understanding my personality I learnt to adjust myself to collaborate with others. In some group projects, I invited my teammates taking the test and getting to knwo each other personalities. It turned out that we work really well.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subsubheading">Music is My Life</h3>
            <p>I played piano since I was 8, and I also knew some basics of other instruments like guitar and flute. Recently, I am preparing for my diploma exame for piano. Sometimes I perform in private concerts and also as an accompanist. In highschool I was the chairman of the school wind orchestra; in University, I am a member of the band society and orchestra. Despite actually playing the music, I enjoy attending concerts regularly in Hong Kong or overseas of all genres, ranging from classical, jazz to contemporary music. </p>

            <h3 class="section-subsubheading">Traveling makes me feel alive</h3>
            <p>“you only live once.” When I got into the University, I started thinking what I want to accomplish in my life. Despite gaining academic awards and working experience, I wanted to do something solely for fun when I am still young.</p>
            <p>Last year, there was a chance for me go traveling to Europe, the experience was great. I enjoy the amazing architecture and nature scene from different countries. Among the places I visited, I love Venice most. The waterways are beautiful and the life is relaxing. In the future, I would like to visit Iceland most, many of my friends told me the view in Iceland is stunning and cannot be found in else where. So, before my graduation, I wish I can travel to more places and try different new things. Below is some snapshots in my trips.</p>
