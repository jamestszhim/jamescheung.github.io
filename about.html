          <h2>Education </h2>
          <p>Hi, I am James. I just finished my 3rd year in HKUST studying Computer Science and General Business Management. I was enrolled in the dual degree program, which offers me a degree in engineering as well as a degree in business administration. So, I got the chances to take courses from both the business and engineering school. I quite like the program as it allows me to explore different areas and connect different ideas across disciplines. The wide exposures also allows me to make sure the way I would like to go for my career. At the same time, I can drill down to one engineering major, which I chose to be Computer Science.</p>
          <p>I think Computer Science is fun, palying around with logics and solving difficult puzzles give me a sense of accomplishment. Among the topics in Computer Science, in particular, I love the topics related to data analysis, mining, visualisation and artificial intelligence. Therefore, both research projects I joined was related to these fields. </p>

            <p>Personally, I quite like to describe my personality using the MBTI since it describe me quite well. MBTI is a theory constructed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers to describe the order of each person’s preference and choice in 4 areas. A person will be described using a 4-letter acronym, which comes from:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Introversion (I) or Extraversion (E) </li>
                <li>Intuition (N) or Sensing (S) </li>
                <li>Thinking (T) or Feeling (F) </li>
                <li>Judging (J) or Perceiving (P) </li>
              </ul>

            <h3 class="section-subsubheading">The ESFJ</h3>
            <p>So, I am of the type ESFJ, that means I am Extraversion, Sensing, Feeling and Judging. In general, ESFJ people, including me, are extraordinarily caring, social and popular people, always eager to help. </p>
            <h3 class="section-subsubheading">Workplace</h3>
            <p>In workplace, I have strong sense of responsibility and loyalty. In my past working experience, I constantly completed my tasks in time and was well-prepared for future jobs. Besides, I am a fast-learner, I pick things up fast. In my undergraduate research project I was able to learn new tools and skills and apply it in the project within short time.</p>
            <h3 class="section-subsubheading">Social Life</h3>
            <p>In social life, I am warm, caring and good at connecting with others. When working with others, I will seek harmony about other people’s feeling and strive for win-win situations for everyone. This personality allows me to be a strong team player and make a lot of good friends.</p>
            <p>Through understanding my personality I learnt to adjust myself to collaborate with others. In some group projects, I invited my teammates taking the test and getting to knwo each other personalities. It turned out that we work really well.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subsubheading">Music is My Life</h3>
            <p>I played piano since I was 8, and I also knew some basics of other instruments like guitar and flute. Recently, I am preparing for my diploma exame for piano. Sometimes I perform in private concerts and also as an accompanist. In highschool I was the chairman of the school wind orchestra; in University, I am a member of the band society and orchestra. Despite actually playing the music, I enjoy attending concerts regularly in Hong Kong or overseas of all genres, ranging from classical, jazz to contemporary music. </p>

            <h3 class="section-subsubheading">Traveling makes me feel alive</h3>
            <p>“You only live once.” When I got into the University, I started thinking what I want to accomplish in my life. Despite gaining academic awards and working experiences, I wanted to do something solely for fun when I am still young.</p>
            <p>Last year, there was a chance for me traveling to Europe, the experience was great. I enjoyed the amazing architectures and nature scenes from different countries. Among the places I visited, I love Venice the most. The waterways are beautiful and the life is relaxing. By the way, my next target is Iceland since many of my friends told me the view in Iceland is stunning and cannot be found in other places. Before my graduation, I wish I can travel to more places and try different new things. Below is some snapshots during my trips.</p>
